[[community-and-support-irc]]
== IRC

Sometimes it's just easier to get help or discuss matters in real time.
The +#scoreflex+ channel on
http://irc.freenode.net/[irc.freenode.net] allows for just that
(http://webchat.freenode.net/[webchat.freenode.net]).

NOTE: IRC discussions tend to exclude large parts of the community. Therefore
Scoreflex core discussions and decisions must take place on the mailing
lists, not IRC.
