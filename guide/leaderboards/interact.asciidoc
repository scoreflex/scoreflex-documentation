=== Interact

Leaderboards can be created, edited, deleted and moderated using the
https://developer.scoreflex.com/account/login[developer interface],
using the “Leaderboards” service.

If you need to batch the creation of leaderboards (for several levels in
your game for instance), you may prefer to use the
http://developer.scoreflex.com/docs/reference/api/v1#service_ManagementService[Management API].

[[guide-leaderboards-interact-create]]
==== Create

A wizard is available to help you create your first leaderboard. The
classical form allows you to choose the identifier of your leaderboard
(leaderboardId).

It is useful to handle the leaderboard yourself if you need to create a
hierarchical structure for your leaderboards. You create
sub-leaderboards by inserting a dot in the leaderboard. Note that a
leaderboard cannot be edited (see the xref:guide-leaderboards-interact-display[display] section).

[[guide-leaderboards-interact-update]]
==== Update

Leaderboard can be edited via the management API or using the developer
interface. In the developer interface, you can either set each
leaderboard attribute using the form, or you can directly edit the
corresponding JSON structure.

To translate labels in the configuration, you have to edit the JSON structure.

See the xref:guide-api-conventions-internationalization[internationalization] guide for more information.

[[guide-leaderboards-interact-display]]
==== Display

The content of leaderboards can be accessed via the
http://developer.scoreflex.com/docs/reference/api/v1#get_\_v1_leaderboards_leaderboardId[Leaderboard REST API]
(API reference) which returns a JSON structure. Scoreflex also
provides a web interface to display leaderboards right into your game.

The web interface displays scores according to the 
configured xref:guide-leaderboards-reference-attributes-scoreformatter[formatting]. 
Two interfaces exists. The
http://developer.scoreflex.com/docs/reference/api/v1#get_\_v1_web_leaderboards_leaderboardId_overview[leaderboard overview]
(API reference) displays a summary of the scores of a
leaderboard, with regard to the current player. It shows the best scores
of friends, and the world leaders. The full
http://developer.scoreflex.com/docs/reference/api/v1#get_\_v1_web_leaderboards_leaderboardId[leaderboard]
(API reference) displays the lists of scores according to filters and modes.

Additionally you can browse through other leaderboards via the menu. The
leaderboard xref:guide-leaderboards-reference-hierarchical-structure[hierarchical structure] determines the order of the
leaderboards in this menu, and thus the navigation.

Scores are also displayed in the
http://developer.scoreflex.com/docs/reference/api/v1#get_\_v1_web_scores_leaderboardId_ranks[rankbox]
(API reference). The rankbox is a small web view that can be easily displayed
after a score submission to display the rank to the player without
displaying a full leaderboard.

[[guide-leaderboards-interact-moderate]]
==== Moderate

Scoreflex has mechanisms to detect and protect from cheaters. But that's
not an easy task and fake scores can still appear in leaderboards. For
this reason, a moderation interface is available in the developer
interface. You can read score meta-data from this interface and delete
scores if required.

See xref:guide-concepts-security[security] for more information.
