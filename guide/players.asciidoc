=== Concepts

You, as a +developer+, create a +game+ to reach the maximum amount of +players+.
Obviously, the players are one of the main entities in Scoreflex. Scoreflex provides
you everything you need to manage your community of players. A player is anyone who has
played one of your game via any gaming device.

[[guide-players-concepts-guest-vs-authenticated-players]]
==== Guest vs Authenticated players

In Scoreflex, there are two major kind of players:

. *Guest*
. *Authenticated*

[[guide-players-concepts-guest-vs-authenticated-players-guests]]
===== Guests

_Guest_ players are also referenced as _Anonymous_ players throughout Scoreflex.
It can be nice to give your players an overview of Scoreflex features
(like leaderboards, challenges, storage, achievements...) and to involve
them deeply in your game competition even if they are not explicitly logged in your game.

To serve that purpose, Scoreflex can generate anonymous players for you with
an automatically generated nickname and avatar. The guest experience, although
limited, can already boost usage to your games and smooth out the conversion to
the authenticated world. It is better to convince your players to authenticate by
involving them into the competition rather than to just abruptly ask them to log in.

A guest player is attached to a gaming device and more precisely to its device id.
Therefore, if Bob launches your game _A_ on his iPhone 4 and plays as a guest, an
anonymous player is created for him. If later, Bob launches your other game _B_ on
his iPhone 4 he will be assigned the same anonymous player.

Suppose that Bob plays as a guest in game _A_ for a week. He has performed some
great scores and unlocked a few achievements. Now that he is convinced by the game,
he wants to play with his friends and share his performances so he decides to log in.
To ease the transition between the guest world and the authenticated world, Scoreflex
can merge an anonymous player activity for a game into an authenticated player. During
the merge process, every scores, unlocked achievements... will be transfered to the
authenticated player. For example, Bob's guest player will disappear from leaderboards
and will be replaced by Bob's authenticated player account.

[[guide-players-concepts-guest-vs-authenticated-players-authenticated]]
===== Authenticated

Players can authenticate to Scoreflex via Facebook and Google+. To learn more about
players authentication please refer to the <<guide-authentication,authentication>>
section of the documentation.


[[guide-players-concepts-friends-and-contacts]]
==== Friends and contacts

When a player authenticates to Scoreflex via a social network all its contacts from the
social network are fetched. All contacts already on Scoreflex become his Scoreflex friends.
To learn more about friends and contacts please refer
to the <<guide-social-networks-friends-and-contacts,friends and contacts>> section
of the documentation.
