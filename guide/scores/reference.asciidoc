A score value is a signed integer coded on 64 bits.

[float]
==== meta

Type: +string+.

For each submitted score, the game can provide some meta-data. Meta-data
save how the score was performed, or give some context. They can be used
to verify the correctness of a score and help fighting cheaters.
Although recommended, meta-data is not mandatory.
