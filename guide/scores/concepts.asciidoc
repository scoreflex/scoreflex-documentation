=== Concepts

Scores are values provided by your game's internal mechanism. A score
can represent different values, such a count of collected items, a time,
or a skill value.

In Scoreflex, scores are just integers. Consequently your game has to be
able to convert non-integers values.

* Times and duration should be converted to milliseconds. Example: 1
minute and 18 seconds = 78000 milliseconds.
* Float values should be rounded to 3 decimals maximum and sent as
integers. Example: 3.57 should be sent as 357.

Although Scoreflex internally represents scores as integers,
configurations are available where needed to format scores correctly.
