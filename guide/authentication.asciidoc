== Authentication

In order to interact with the Scoreflex API you have first to
authenticate your player to obtain an access token and a sid. There are
currently 3 different ways to authenticate via the
http://developer.scoreflex.com/docs/reference/api/v1#OAuthService[authentication
service]:

. Guest authentication
. Web authentication
. Client-side authentication

=== Guest authentication

[[guide-authentication-guest-authentication-concepts]]
==== Concepts

_Guest_ players are also referenced as _Anonymous_ players throughout Scoreflex.
It can be nice to give your players an overview of Scoreflex features
(like leaderboards, challenges, storage, achievements...) and to involve
them deeply in your game competition even if they are not explicitly logged in your game.

To serve that purpose, Scoreflex can generate anonymous players for you with
an automatically generated nickname and avatar. The guest experience, although
limited, can already boost usage to your games and smooth out the conversion to
the authenticated world. It is better to convince your players to authenticate by
involving them into the competition rather than to just abruptly ask them to log in.

A guest player is attached to a gaming device and more precisely to its device id.
Therefore, if Bob launches your game _A_ on his iPhone 4 and plays as a guest, an
anonymous player is created for him. If later, Bob launches your other game _B_ on
his iPhone 4 he will be assigned the same anonymous player.
