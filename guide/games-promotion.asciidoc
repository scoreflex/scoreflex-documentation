== Games promotion

Developers often promote their other games inside their games with a
“More games” button. It can be tedious to maintain this feature.
Scoreflex comes with a predefined UI component for this purpose. It will
show the list of all your Scoreflex enabled games with their icon,
description, genres and a play button if the game is playable from the
viewing device.

You can also obtain all your games information from the dedicated REST
API endpoint to integrate this feature with your own UI.
