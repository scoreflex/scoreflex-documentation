== Search

On Scoreflex, one can search for any player, game or developer through a
search bar in the left menu of our web interface. Results are proposed
as-you-type with typo-tolerance, they are localized, and we put quality
result first.

An API is also proposed so you can integrate this feature in your own UI.

Players in your game won't leave. Only your studio, your games and your
players will be returned. This will focus attention to your universe and
ultimately increase retention.
