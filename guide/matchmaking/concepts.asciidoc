=== Concepts

Matchmaking is the process of finding suitable mates using diverse criteria.

It is used to match players with similar and compatible wishes so they
can play together.

Scoreflex can match players using two types of criteria: player-centric,
and request-centric. One can decide who can match, in addition to
defining compatible requests.

This way a player can play with his fellows that have the same wishes,
instead of any random player in the world.

For instance, a player can ask to match against a player with similar
skill, of the opposite gender, who lives nearby, and of similar age!
